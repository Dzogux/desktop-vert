e's a breakdown of the calculation:

    Base Fare:
    A minimum price is set for a short distance (e.g., 3 minutes and 1 km). 

Distance:
A price per kilometer is added to the base fare, with different rates for travel within the city and to the suburbs. 
Time:
A price per minute is added to the base fare, especially when factoring in wait time. 
Pickup Fee:
A fee may be added based on the distance between the vehicle and the pickup location and the time it takes to reach the user. 
Wait Time:
A free wait time is included, but paid wait time is added if the free time is exceeded. 
Cancellation Fee:
A fee may be applied if a ride is canceled after a certain point, especially if the vehicle has already been dispatched. 
Surge Pricing:
In certain situations, like increased demand or reduced availability, the price may increase. 

example:
In Yaoundé, the minimum price is set at 460 FCFA for the first 3 minutes and 1 km. The price per minute of wait time is 27 FCFA. The price per kilometer is 100 FCFA within the city and 160 FCFA in the suburbs. A pickup fee is also calculated based on the distance to the pickup point. 



how they register:
Yango drivers register and are verified through a multi-step process involving the (Yango Pro app), document uploads, and potentially a photo check. First, drivers download the Yango Pro app and register using their passport for verification. Next, they complete a photo check and upload necessary documents, such as a valid ID or passport, SOAT (if applicable), and driver's license. Mandatory documents include a copy of their Tax Identification Number (NIT Unipersonal) and Employer Registration (ROE-Ministry of Labor). After completing the registration form and document submission, drivers can start receiving ride requests. 



    SOAT (Seguro Obligatorio de Accidentes de Tránsito):
    In Colombia, the SOAT is a mandatory insurance policy for all vehicles. It covers expenses related to traffic accidents, including injuries or death to those involved. By verifying the SOAT, Yango ensures that drivers have this crucial insurance, protecting them and their passengers in case of accidents. 

NIT (Número de Identificación Tributaria):
The NIT is a unique tax identification number for individuals and businesses. In the context of Yango, it's likely used for identifying and managing drivers for tax and legal purposes. 
Employer Registration:
This likely refers to the process of registering drivers as independent contractors or employees, depending on the local regulations and Yango's operational structure. It helps Yango comply with labor laws and ensure drivers are properly classified for tax and legal purposes. 
Background Checks and Vetting:
Yango also conducts thorough background checks on drivers, including verifying their licenses and vehicle information, to maintain safety standards.
